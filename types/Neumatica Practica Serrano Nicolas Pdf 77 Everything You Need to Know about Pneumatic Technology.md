Pneumatics is the branch of engineering that deals with the use of compressed air or gas to perform mechanical work. It is widely used in industrial applications, such as automation, robotics, manufacturing, and transportation. Pneumatics can also be found in everyday objects, such as bicycle pumps, air brakes, and pneumatic tires.
 
Neumatica Practica is a book written by Antonio Serrano Nicolas, a professor of mechanical engineering at the Polytechnic University of Valencia, Spain. The book was first published in 2010 by Ediciones Paraninfo, and it is available as an ebook for $20.25[^1^]. The book is aimed at students and professionals who want to learn the basics of pneumatics and its applications.

- Production, distribution, and treatment of air: how to generate, store, transport, and condition compressed air.
- Pneumatic cylinders: how to choose and use linear actuators.
- Rotary actuators, grippers, and pneumatic motors: how to choose and use rotary actuators.
- Distribution and control valves: how to choose and use valves to control the flow and direction of air.
- Regulation, control, and blocking: how to adjust the pressure, speed, and force of pneumatic systems.
- Signal detectors: how to use sensors and switches to detect positions, pressures, flows, and temperatures.
- Vacuum techniques: how to create and use vacuum for suction and lifting.
- Other pneumatic components: how to use filters, lubricators, silencers, accumulators, counters, timers, etc.
- Tubes and fittings: how to select and connect pneumatic pipes and hoses.
- Control and operation of actuators: how to design pneumatic circuits using logic elements.
- Elementary pneumatic circuits with one or two actuators: how to solve simple problems using basic components.
- Pneumatic circuits with more than two actuators: how to solve complex problems using advanced components.
- Design of pneumatic circuits by systematic methods: how to apply graphical and algebraic methods to design optimal circuits.
- Introduction to electrical circuits for automation: how to use electrical components to control pneumatic systems.
- Circuits with solenoid valves: how to use electrically operated valves to control pneumatic systems.

The book also includes a final section with the solutions to the exercises proposed throughout the chapters. The book has 456 pages and contains numerous examples, illustrations, tables, charts, formulas, and exercises. The book uses a simple and accessible language that makes it easy to understand for beginners. The book also provides essential data for a proper training in pneumatics. The book is based on the author's extensive experience as a teacher and researcher in pneumatics.
 
Neumatica Practica is a comprehensive and practical guide that covers all the aspects of pneumatics from theory to practice. It is a valuable resource for anyone who wants to learn or improve their skills in pneumatics. The book can be downloaded as a PDF file from various websites[^2^] [^3^] [^4^], but it is recommended to buy the original ebook from Google Books[^1^] to support the author and publisher.
